          <h3>LUKE'S NHL POWER RANKINGS ROUND 1</h3>
          <h5>LUKE LINNEHAN, <span class="w3-opacity">January 31, 2021</span></h5>
        </div>
          <br>

        <div class="w3-justify">
            <p>The NHL has completed two and a half weeks of action so far as we enter February. Here is my power rankings since the first puck drop through January 31st.</p>
<br>
            
<h5>THE BOTTOM HALF</h5>
            <p>31. Ottawa Senators (1-7-1): Points Leader: Brady Tkachuk (3 G 4 A 7 P)</p>
            <p>30. Detroit Red Wings (2-6-2): Points Leader: Dylan Larkin (4 G 4 A 8 P)</p>
            <p>29. San Jose Sharks (3-5-0): Points Leader: Tomas Hertl (3 G 4 A 7 P)</p>
            <p>28. Anaheim Ducks (3-5-2): Points Leader: Ryan Getzlaf (0 G 5 A 5 P)</p>
            <p>27. Chicago Blackhawks (3-4-3): Points Leader: Patrick Kane (4 G 6 A 10 P)</p>
            <p>26. New York Rangers (2-4-2): Points Leader: Artemi Panarin (4 G 5 A 9 P)</p>
            <p>25. Arizona Coyotes (3-4-1): Points Leader: Christian Dvorak (3 G 4 A 7 P)</p>
            <p>24. New York Islanders (3-4-2): Points Leader: Mathew Barzal (4 G 6 A 10 P)</p>
            <p>23. Los Angeles Kings (3-3-2): Points Leader: Anze Kopitar (1 G 11 A 12 P)</p>
            <p>22. Nashville Predators (4-4-0): Points Leader: Filip Forsberg (4 G 2 A 6 P)</p>
            <p>21. Buffalo Sabres (4-4-2): Points Leader: Jack Eichel (2 G 9 A 11 P)</p>
            <p>20. Edmonton Oilers (5-6-0): Points Leader: Connor McDavid (8 G 14 A 22 P)</p>
            <p>19. Columbus Blue Jackets (4-3-3): Points Leader: Oliver Bjorkstrand (3 G 5 A 8 P)</p>
            <p>18. New Jersey Devils (4-3-2): Points Leader: Miles Wood (5 G 3 A 8 P)</p>
            <p>17. Minnesota Wild (6-4-0): Points Leader: Jordan Greenway (2 G 8 A 10 P)</p>
            <br>
            
<h5>SWEET SIXTEEN</h5>
            <h6>16. Calgary Flames (3-3-1): Points Leader: Johnny Gaudreau (5 G 4 A 9 P)</h6>
            <p>The Flames have struggled early on to score but have looked great on defense. Johnny hockey is off and running with 5 goals and the powerplay looks good early on. New goalie Jacob Markstrom has been good and I think the Flames will be in a tough battle for the 3rd or 4th spot in the North division.</p>
            
            <h6>15. Vancouver Canucks (6-5-0): Points Leader: Brock Boeser (8 G 3 A 11 P)</h6>
            <p>Vancouver came out really slow and looked sluggish on offense without J.T. Miller. Goaltending hasn’t been superb so far and it took Elias Petterson a long time to pick up his first goal. However, they have turned it around and now look like the team everybody thought we were going to see. Quinn Hughes continues to dominate on the powerplay and sniper Brock Boeser already has 8 goals this season.</p>
            
            <h6>14. Winnipeg Jets (5-3-0): Points Leader: Nikolaj Ehlers (5 G 6 A 11 P)</h6>
            <p>The Jets just acquired Pierre Luc-Dubois from the Blue Jackets swapping number 2 overall pick in 2016 Patrick Laine who has been known to be a locker room cancer. I think this trade gives Winnipeg a legit chance to compete with Mark Scheifele and Dubois up the middle with excellent wings in Connor and Ehlers.</p>
            
            <h6>13. Pittsburgh Penguins (5-3-1): Points Leader: Sidney Crosby (4 G 4 A 8 P)</h6>
            <p>The Penguins have had some good moments and some bad moments. Hopefully Malkin and Letang work on their 2 on 0’s in practice some more after floundering a great chance to beat the Bruins last Tuesday. However, every game has been close for Pittsburgh and they show some great signs up front obviously with the likes of Crosby, Guentzel, etc. The goalies have not been great for Pittsburgh at all and the loss of Matt Murray might be more significant than the Penguins were anticipating.</p>
            
            <h6>12. Florida Panthers (5-0-1): Points Leader: Patric Hornqvist (5 G 2 A 7 P)</h6>
            <p>A pleasant surprise so far in the NHL, the Panthers have not dropped a regulation game all year yet. This team is very gritty and has won some close games and has been reliant on their defense in crucial spots. This might be a sleeper team but I can’t see them doing much against the teams ranked above them here.</p>
            
            <h6>11. Philadelphia Flyers (7-2-1): Points Leader: James Van Riemsdyk (5 G 8 A 13 P)</h6>
            <p>Philadelphia is off to a good start with James Van Riemsdyk buzzing to start the season. Nolan Patrick appears to be turning into the player the Flyers wanted coming out of the draft and has been very solid for Philadelphia early on. Carter Hart is a fantastic goaltender, however, after dropping two on the road in Boston and losing at home to Buffalo, Philly’s chemistry doesn’t seem to be clicking just quite yet.</p>
            
            <h6>10. St. Louis Blues (6-2-1): Points Leader: Brayden Schenn (6 G 4 A 10 P)</h6>
            <p>The Blues have been very strong early and continue to look strong on offense even without superstar sniper Vladimir Tarasenko. Torey Krug scored his first St. Louis goal this past week and has been a nice addition to the power play where he thrived in Boston. The big forwards for St. Louis continues to be nightmares for opposing skaters as they are a very physical and well coached bunch.</p>
            
            <h6>9. Dallas Stars (4-1-1): Points Leader: Joe Pavelski (5 G 5 A 10 P)</h6>
            <p>Despite the Stars season being delayed by the Covid-19 virus, they instantly came out firing on the offensive end with veteran Joe Pavelski leading the charge. Tyler Seguin has yet to play for the Stars but that hasn’t appeared to slow much down for the reigning Western Conference champions. Klingberg and Heiskanen continue to dazzle and the Stars are right back in the mix this season.</p>
            
            <h6>8. Colorado Avalanche (6-3-1): Points Leader: Nathan MacKinnon (2 G 12 A 14 P)</h6>
            <p>I have been very high on the Avalanche since the conclusion of last year’s postseason and their new acquisitions. Rookie defender Bo Byram has looked strong and comfortable playing alongside 2020 Calder trophy winner Cale Makar. Nathan MacKinnon has been elite so far but recently was injured against the Wild in yesterday’s affair, hopefully he will return quickly. However the Av’s come in at 8 for me because they have not been very consistent and have at times looked shaky but I expect them to dominate and move up this list quickly the next few weeks. </p>
            
            <h6>7. Toronto Maple Leafs (7-2-1): Points Leader: Mitchell Marner (5 G 9 A 14 P)</h6>
            <p>The most promising thing so far for Maple Leafs fans in how Toronto has been able to win close games which has been an issue in the past. The defense has improved from the prior years which has let them down in the playoffs time after time. Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner look unstoppable right now and John Tavares leads the locker room and clearly has made a big impact this year with the team looking energized and hungry to win.</p>
            
            <h6>6. Carolina Hurricanes (5-1-0): Points Leader: Andrei Svechnikov (4 G 2 A 6 P)</h6>
            <p>Carolina has had a dream start to the year as their defense has been very strong to start the season. Andrei Svechnikov is emerging as a superstar alongside Sebastian Aho who is looking to build off of his breakout year in 2020. They recently dominated the Stars and held the Lightning to 0 goals. They will be looking to establish themselves at the top of the league for years to come.</p>
            
            <h6>5. Tampa Bay Lightning (4-1-1): Points Leader: Steven Stamkos (3 G 4 A 7 P)</h6>
            <p>The defending Stanley Cup champions have looked solid to begin the new campaign. Steven Stamkos has returned from injury, however the loss of Nikita Kucherov has been evident so far with the offense struggling against the Hurricanes in a 1-0 overtime loss. This is still the most talented team in the league though and even despite their subpar play, the Lightning still have 9 points in 6 games and will soon begin to put the puck in the back of the net more frequently.</p>
            
            <h6>4. Vegas Golden Knights (5-1-1): Points Leader: Mark Stone (2 G 9 A 11 P)</h6>
            <p>Prior to the first puck drop of the new year, Vegas named Mark Stone their first ever captain in franchise history and so far his leadership has been evident. The Knights have been firing on all cylinders and the addition of Alex Pietrangelo has strengthened the defense. Vegas arguably the best goaltending tandem in the league in Lehner and Fleury who have been strong so far.</p>
            
            <h6>3. Boston Bruins (5-1-2): Points Leader: Brad Marchand (5 G 6 A 11 P)</h6>
            <p>Despite being down superstar winger David Pastrnak for the first 7 games, the Bruins went 4-0-0 in their first four home games sweeping both Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The Bruins special teams have been amazing ranking 5th in the powerplay and 3rd in the penalty kill. Their young defensemen have looked very comfortable early and goalie Tuukka Rask has been dynamite in crucial situations for Boston.</p>
            
            <h6>2. Montreal Canadiens (5-1-2): Points Leader: Tyler Toffoli (6 G 3 A 9 P)</h6>
            <p>The Canadiens have hit the ice running and have dominated. Center Nick Suzuki is living up to the hype showing his bright future being a strong 200 foot player. Tyler Toffoli dominated in back to back games against the Vancouver Canucks scoring 5 times and adding two assists. They are a big and physical team that has looked prepared for the start of the new year.</p>
            
            <h6>1. Washington Capitals (6-0-3): Points Leader: Nicklas Backstrom (5 G 8 A 13 P)</h6>
            <p>The Capitals have battled Covid-19 issues within the team and lost goalie Henrik Lundqvist prior to the start of the season. Recently, the Capitals defeated the New York Islanders 6-3 after being down 3-0 after the first period. On Saturday, they beat the Boston Bruins 4-3 thanks to captain Alex Ovechkin who wristed one by Rask under a minute in overtime.</p>
