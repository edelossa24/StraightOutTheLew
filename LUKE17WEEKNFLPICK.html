<h5>Atlanta Falcons (4-11) @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers (10-5)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Tampa Bay (-6.5)</p>
            <p>Tom Brady is about to begin his 18th playoff run but his first as a wild card team. These two teams met in Week 15 where the Falcons got up 24-7 but however ended up losing 31-27 at home. With a playoff seed on the line for the Bucs, I don’t see them losing this weekend at home to a disappointing Atlanta Falcons team.</p>

<h5>Dallas Cowboys (6-9) @ New York Giants (5-10)</h5>
            <p>Spread: New York (+1.5)</p>
            <p>With the NFC East title still up for grabs, this game is massive for both teams.  This will be the first big game for the sophomore QB Daniel Jones. Andy Dalton has played in many big games with the Bengals before but in this game I think Joe Judge’s Giants defense will step up and the Giants will have to wait for the result of Washington vs Philadelphia to see if they clinched a playoff berth.</p>

<h5>New York Jets (2-13) @ New England Patriots (6-9)</h5>
            <p>Spread: New England (-3)</p>
            <p>New England has looked awful the past three weeks and the Jets have now won 2 games in a row. We don’t know how Bill will control the QB position in the last week of the year as Newton has struggled heavily. This game has no impact except for the 2021 NFL Draft placement with the Jets already clinching the 2nd position last week and the Pats sitting at 14th this week.</p>

<h5>Minnesota Vikings (6-9) @ Detroit Lions (5-10)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Detroit (+4.5)</p>
            <p>Kirk Cousins looks to finish the season on a high note going up against the Lions who were embarrassed by Brady and the Bucs last weekend. Stafford will be back for Detroit but we don’t think it will make too much of a difference.</p>

<h5>Pittsburgh Steelers (12-3) @ Cleveland Browns (10-5)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Cleveland (-9.5)</p>
            <p>Pittsburgh will be resting QB Ben Roethlisberger for the playoffs meaning that Mason Rudolph will be starting against the Browns for the first time since last year’s incident between he and Myles Garrett. The Browns need a win to clinch a playoff berth and with a loss would need help from the Jaguars to defeat the Colts.  Despite Cleveland’s history in big games I can’t imagine them losing this one.</p>

<h5>Baltimore Ravens (10-5) @ Cincinnati Bengals (4-10-1)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Cincinnati (+13.5)</p>
            <p>Bengals fans should be eager for next year with the return of Joe Burrow and another draft to improve the team. In this game, the Ravens have been dominating lately and with a playoff spot on the line, they will come out hot early and blow the Bengals out.</p>

<h5>Miami Dolphins (10-5) @ Buffalo Bills (12-3)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Buffalo (-2)</p>
            <p>The Bills need either a win or a Pittsburgh loss to clinch the 2nd seed in the AFC and have a tough week 17 matchup with the hungry Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins have many scenarios for a playoff berth and a lot would have to go right for them with a loss vs Buffalo. These two teams met earlier in week 2 this year but rookie Tua Tagovailoa did not play at QB for Miami and still only lost by 3. However, I see Josh Allen taking care of business and wrapping up the season at 13-3.</p>

<h5>Seattle Seahawks (11-4) @ San Francisco 49ers (6-9)</h5>
            <p>Spread: San Francisco (+7)</p>
            <p>An injury plagued season for the 49ers has made this already difficult enough season even longer and more grueling. The Seahawks have a chance still at the 1 seed in the NFC after defeating the Rams in week 16. The 49ers will also rely on third string QB C.J. Beathard this weekend after a strong game last week. He must not turn the ball over and be able to manage the game in order for Kyle Shanahan to have a chance this weekend against an improving Seattle defense.</p>

<h5>Arizona Cardinals (8-7) @ Los Angeles Rams (9-6)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Los Angeles (+3)</p>
            <p>The Rams will be without QB Jared Goff this weekend and it will be tough to overcome against a talented Cardinals defense. Kyler Murray looks to clinch a playoff berth for the Cardinals first time in 5 years. The Rams defense will need to play strong if they have any chance in this game as they also fight for their playoff lives.</p>

<h5>Jacksonville Jaguars (1-14) @ Indianapolis Colts (10-5)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Indianapolis (-14)</p>
            <p>It is very simple. Colts need a win and either a Browns, Titans, Ravens, or Dolphins loss to make the playoffs. Despite the Jaguars only win coming against the Colts this year, the Colts will for sure take care of business this weekend. This could also be the last time we see Philip Rivers in the NFL as he’s hinted at retirement.</p>

<h5>Tennessee Titans (10-5) @ Houston Texans (4-11)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Houston (+7.5)</p>
            <p>Watson will play his last game of the season against a weak Tennessee defense where he could potentially put up major numbers. However, this game belongs to the Titans as Derrick Henry will dominate the Texans rush defense and control the game for the Titans. Tennessee will have no problems and cruise to an AFC South division title and move on to the playoffs.</p>

<h5>Las Vegas Raiders (7-8) @ Denver Broncos (5-10)</h5>
            <p>Spread: Denver (+2.5)</p>
            <p>This is a very intriguing matchup between two very inconsistent teams all year. Coming off tough loss last Saturday, the Raiders should be motivated in their final game to get a win over a disappointing Broncos team. Drew Lock needs to have a good game and prove to John Elway that he can truly be a reliable starter in the NFL.</p>

            <p>Spread: Kansas City (+3.5)</p>
            <p>Kansas City will be resting Patrick Mahomes and most likely their other offensive star power. The Chargers played well against them in week 2 and rookie QB Justin Herbert has some experience under his belt but still yet to win a big game. Without almost all their top players after clinching the 1 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs really don’t care about this week.</p>

            <p>Spread: Chicago (+4)</p>
            <p>The Bears win and they make the playoffs. However, the Packers will be motivated to clinch a first round bye. This will be a good game early with QB Mitchell Trubisky looking solid the past couple weeks but MVP favorite Aaron Rodgers will open this one up and clinch home field advantage for his squad.</p>

            <p>Spread: Carolina (+5.5)</p>
            <p>Not really much in this game despite the Saints being without their whole running back core after some Covid-19 concerns. The Saints will want to win this game to lock up some seeding and hopefully be able to have a home game in  the divisional round if they are to advance.</p>

            <p>Everybody’s favorite team the Washington Football Team will attempt to look up the NFC East Title with a win this weekend in Philadelphia. Rookie QB Jalen Hurts has looked strong for the Eagles since replacing Carson Wentz but will have his hands full with the Football Team defense. The winner of Dallas and New York will look on closely but overall I believe Washington will win this division with a win on Sunday Night Football.</p>
