      <p class="w3-opacity">Host</p>
      <p>Chris Cimino is a resident of Maine and is an avid Boston sports fan (aside from the Bruins because hockey is boring). His fandom extends to the University of Michigan for college sports. Chris is a contrarian on the podcast and his negativity in regards to teams he roots for is unmatched. He makes sure to never be overly positive about his teams like Bay Area fans. He does not, however, bandwagon on certain teams like others on the show. Chris’s first love was baseball and, he had experience playing basketball and baseball in high school. He has since moved on to attend college in Lewiston, Maine at Bates College.</p>

      <p>Luke “Linny” Linnehan grew up in a suburb just south of Boston, MA and is an active Patriots, Bruins, and Red Sox fan.

His favorite college football team is the Florida Gators because his youth baseball coach played D1 Baseball for the Gators.  However, Luke actively roots for Boston College in all sports as he has a long family tradition at the school.  Luke is known to be very passionate about his sports takes and loves to debate.
