          <h3>KELLEN MOND'S CAREER AT TEXAS A&M SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN</h3>
          <h5>CHRIS CIMINO, <span class="w3-opacity">January 3, 2021</span></h5>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-justify">
<p>The Texas A&M Aggies finished off their great season with a 41-27 win over North Carolina in the Orange Bowl tonight. Jimbo Fisher has been at A&M for 3 years and already has the team competing for playoff spots. His tremendous job in recruiting and championship level coaching deserve a ton of credit, but so does his ever so steady QB. </p> 
            
<p>Kellen Mond was a 4 star recruit back in 2016 when then Texas A&M head coach Kevin Sumlin recruited the quarterback. The tenure of Kevin Sumlin was coming to end at A&M after Mond’s first season. Sumlin was not recruiting well enough to compete for championships in the SEC, and that showed after a 7-5 campaign in Mond’s freshman year, which he played 10 games of. Mond was not great in his freshman year, but the perspective of a new coach coming in evidently aided in the quarterback’s development. Mond was A&M’s starter in every game for the rest of his career with the Aggies, and he got better each year. </p>
            
<p>In his Sophomore campaign, Mond threw for over 3000 yards and 24 TDs as the Aggies finished 9-3 (and should’ve beaten Clemson). It was a great start for the Fisher era and it looked like he had his QB.</p>
            
<p>In year 2, the Aggies went 7-5, but all of their losses were to top 15 teams due to their brutal schedule in the SEC and their scheduled game with Clemson. Mond though, despite having to play against all of those defenses, threw for almost 3000 yards and 20 TDs. </p>
            
<p>When year three came around, Fisher had created a top 11 talented team (247 Sports). The Aggies boasted their best year in a long time as they went 9-1 with a top level defense and some very steady quarterback play. Mond threw for 19 TDs and just 3 picks in 10 games. </p>
            
<p>The Aggies are in a great spot to compete for SEC titles moving forward. Much of that is thanks to Jimbo Fisher, but having a steady quarterback during a coaching shift is vital, and Kellen Mond was just that as he left the program much better than he found it. When Texas A&M wins a championship (and they will under Fisher), people should remember the job that Kellen Mond did to help stabilize and keep the program moving in the right direction. </p>
            
<p>Legends never die, and Kellen Mond is an Aggie legend forever.</p>
