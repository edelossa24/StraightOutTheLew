    <h2>STRAIGHT OUT THE LEW STORES</h2>
            
            <p>If you order products from one of the Stores made available through our Platform, the following terms apply:</p>
            
            <h4>Products/Orders</h4>
            
            <p>Certain products or services may be available exclusively online. These products or services may have limited quantities and are subject to return or exchange only according to our Return Policy.</p>
            
            <p>We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors and images of our products that appear at the store. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of any color will be accurate.</p>
            
            <p>We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice, at the sole discretion of us. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time.

            <p>We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. In the event that we cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.

            <p>All pricing is subject to change without prior notice. We reserve the right to adjust the price of any product sold through our online stores at any time in our sole discretion. In the event that a product is listed on the Website at an incorrect price due to a typographical error or error in pricing information, we will have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for the product listed at the incorrect price. We will have the right to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we will make reasonable attempts to notify you and will issue a credit to your credit card account in the amount of the incorrect price. </p>
            
            <p>To the extent that we are required by law to charge and collect taxes on products that we sell, such taxes are charged based on the tax laws applicable to the location to which the order is being shipped or delivered. At checkout, all appropriate taxes will be added to the order total. The tax amount displayed during checkout is an estimate of the tax applicable to your order. This amount may vary slightly from the actual amount of tax payable in connection with your order due to different tax rates which apply as a result of the origin and destination of the item(s) being purchased, as well as other factors.</p>

The demand for arbitration shall be made by any party hereto within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in any event shall not be made after the date when institution of legal proceeding, based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question, would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Discovery issues shall be decided by the arbitrator. Post-hearing briefs shall be permitted. The arbitrator shall render a decision within twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the hearing(s). In reaching a decision, the arbitrator shall have no authority to change, extend, modify or suspend any of the terms of this Agreement, or to grant an award or remedy any greater than that which would be available from a court under the statutory or common law theory asserted. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion that includes the factual and legal basis for any decision and award. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of Maine or federal law, or any of them, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties may seek, from a court of competent jurisdiction, provisional remedies or injunctive relief in support of their respective rights and remedies hereunder without waiving any right to arbitration. However, the merits of any action that involves such provisional remedies or injunctive relief, including, without limitation, the terms of any permanent injunction, shall be determined by arbitration under this paragraph. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator shall allocate all costs and expenses of the arbitration (including legal and accounting fees and expenses of the respective parties) to the parties in the proportions that reflect their relative success on the merits (including the successful assertion of any defenses). </p>
            
            <p>You agree to pursue any arbitration in an individual capacity and not as class representative or class member in any purported class action proceeding.</p>
            
            <p>BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THEY ARE IRREVOCABLY WAIVING ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIVITIES CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.</p>
