          <h3>CELTICS LOSS TO DETROIT BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF SAME OLD ISSUES FOR THE TEAM</h3>
          <h5>CHRIS CIMINO, <span class="w3-opacity">January 2, 2021</span></h5>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-justify">
<p>The Boston Celtics fell 96-93 last night to the winless Detroit Pistons. What the Celtics did in this game brings back bad memories of major problems from last year’s season. While the Celtics did make it to the ECF last year, that is far from the expectation in Boston, and many feel that they should’ve beaten Miami in that series. While home court and seeding didn’t truly matter last year, it has the opportunity to matter this season with the possibility of fans in the stands later in the year. Losing to the Detroit Pistons does not help your seed.</p> 
            
<p>The Celtics defeated the Raptors in the playoffs last year. They were the far superior team talent wise. The reason that Toronto was higher in the standings? They get up for every game and come to play every night. The Celtics may very well have lost to Toronto last year if they had to be on the road in that series (Toronto has been a house of horrors for the C’s). The bottom line is that last year, the Celtics also had their fair share of let down games against bad teams. Bad home losses to Detroit and Brooklyn come to mind, and it looks like this team will be no different. They came to play against a bad Memphis team and blew them out, and they play the 0-4 Pistons and do not show up to the arena in the 1st half.</p>
            
<p>Another issue that came about in this game was the ability to close games. This was less of an issue in the regular season last year because of Kemba Walker’s ability to make big shots and create space for others. We saw in the bubble though when Toronto went to a box and 1 on Kemba and when Miami focused on Kemba, that Jayson Tatum was forced to take the big shots, and he didn’t make them. This season, we saw Tatum take a very poor shot against Indiana late in the game, and we saw some poor shots last night that missed late in the game. Jaylen Brown has been known to make some clutch shots, but he also missed a couple late last night. The Celtics didn’t score in the final 4:15 of the game. They took too many 3s, and their two best players missed two wide open looks to end the game off of some beautiful play calls from Brad Stevens. Late game execution needs to get better, and I fear until Kemba Walker returns, it’s going to be very frustrating watching this team in close games. My advice? Get the ball to Jaylen Brown and let him go to work. He has been the Celtics best player this season and has made some clutch shots over his career. Let him be the top option late in the game.</p>
            
<p>The bottom line: Will the Celtics be a top 4-5 seed in the east? In all likelihood they will be, but there are going to be some bumps along the way especially until Walker returns. When he does though, there are no more excuses, and this team needs to get over the hump SOON.</p>
